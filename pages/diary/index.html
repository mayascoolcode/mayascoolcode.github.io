            <p>Welcome to my first diary entry! I've finally finished coding this website, and I'm moving on to hosting it. It's been a fun project for me to create, making websites is very fun. Even though, this website is very simple. It is mainly inpsired by <a href="http://undergroundfortress.web.fc2.com/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">undergroundfortress</a> and <a href="https://sbbu.neocities.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sbbu</a>. I wanted it to be simple enough to be added to over time, and minimal to keep up with. I also like the old website look and feel.</p>
                <br><p>I mostly stared this project as a way to combat my art block, I am nervous about the internet and sharing things online, and I wanted an alternative platform where I feel free to experiment a bit more. I am looking for ways to combine mediums in the things I create to make more cohesive projecsts. Projects that actually appeal to me. </p>
                <br><p>I feel like sometimes my art feel meaningless because it has to message, or I have no words to accompany it. I feel this the most when creaing music, as writing lyrics is very difficult for me. I am more interested in pursing what is familiar to me, rather than trying to mold myself to some image. As a heavy daydreamer, it is much more fun to worldbuild and conceptualize things for yourself. Even if it looks strange or goofy, it's much more fun to have fun.</p>
                <br><p>I am working on creating a new schedule today as well, to stay on track creatively and stuff. I wish I had more to share on the website, but it is just in it's baby stage right now. I'm thinking about using calanders and shit again, I feel like that might be very important for me to stay consistent too. I remember using planners as a kid, that was a really good idea.</p>
                <br><p>Thinking of a few simple projects I could make right now, I am going to make a section on the main stage that shows my current projecsts. I feel that will motivate me. Anyways, not much more to say.</p>
