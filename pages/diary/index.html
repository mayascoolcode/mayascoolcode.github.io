                <p>Welcome to my first diary entry! I've finally finished coding this website, and I'm moving on to hosting it. It's been a fun project for me to create, making websites is very fun. I mostly stared this project as a way to combat my art block, I am nervous about the internet and sharing things online, and I wanted an alternative platform where I feel free to experiment a bit more. I am looking for ways to combine mediums in the things I create to make more cohesive projecsts. Projects that actually appeal to me. </p>
                <br><p>I feel like sometimes my art feel meaningless because it has to message, or I have no words to accompany it. I feel this the most when creaing music, as writing lyrics is very difficult for me. I am more interested in pursing what is familiar to me, rather than trying to mold myself to some image. As a heavy daydreamer, it is much more fun to worldbuild and conceptualize things for yourself.</p>
                <br><p>I am working on creating a new schedule today as well, to stay on track creatively and stuff. I wish I had more to share on the website, but it is just in it's baby stage right now. You can see a <a href="/pages/drawings/">self portrait</a> I created this year though.</p>
                <br><p>Thinking of a few simple projects I could make right now, I am going to make a section on the main stage that shows my current projecsts. I feel that will motivate me. Anyways, not much more to say. I hope you enjoy my presence.</p>
