                <p>Welcome to my diary page. Here, I update the website with my thoughts and feelings. It feels much better to put it on a website like this, it truly feels free. I can use other socials for mostly just showing my art, and my website for my personal things.</p>
                <br><p>Not much to really say right now, I am just settings things up and figuring them out. In the meantime, have fun looking around. I've created an IG for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mtchtmth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">microblogging</a>, so take a look at that too if you'd like. I got locked out of my tumblr account a long time ago, so this is my alternative.</p>

                <p>I'm working on a lot for myself starting now. I am detoxing, I am removing, I am restarting. I realize, as someone who wants to go somewhere, I have to remove myself from anything that does not serve me and is in conflict with who I want to be and my goals. I have examined a lot of my behavior, and I realize I have many people pleasing tendancies. This is probably because I have grown up in such constant chaos in my most formative years. But I give myself credit; I am smart, creative, and deeply intuitive. It is time for me to uplift and trust myself. The fact I can acknowledge and name these things lets me know all that I need to. </p>
                <br><p>I have always felt much older on the inside. Probably because I have spent so much of my childhood wishing I was older, because then, age correlated with freedom to me. I realize now, in reality, that is the inverse. I am ready to kill my niceness, as truly, it is just fake. I am fake, I was, and that is me living in reality now. </p>
                <br><p>This is hilarious, I'm basically going back to who I was in highschool. I was so much more wise then.</p>
