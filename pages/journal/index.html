                <p>Welcome to my diary page. Here, I update the website with my thoughts and feelings. It feels much better to put it on a website like this, it truly feels free. I can use other socials for mostly just showing my art, and my website for my personal things.</p>
                <br><p>Not much to really say right now, I am just settings things up and figuring them out. In the meantime, have fun looking around. I've created an IG for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/matchetmoth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">microblogging</a>, so take a look at that too if you'd like. I got locked out of my tumblr account a long time ago, so this is my alternative.</p>
